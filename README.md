# MetalSplatter
Render 3D Gaussian Splats using Metal on Apple platforms (iOS/iPhone/iPad, macOS, and visionOS/Vision Pro)

This is a Swift/Metal library for rendering scenes captured via the techniques described in [3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/). It will let you load up a PLY and visualize it on iOS, macOS, and visionOS (using amplification for rendering in stereo on Vision Pro). Modules include
* MetalSplatter, the core library to render a frame
* PLYIO, for reading binary or ASCII PLY files (not writing yet, despite the name); this is standalone, feel free to use it if you just have a hankering to load up some PLY files for some reason.
* SplatIO, a thin layer on top of PLYIO to interpret these PLY files as sets of splats
* SampleApp, a mini app to demonstrate how to use the above (based on Apple template code) -- don't expect much, it's intentionally minimal, just an illustration
* SampleBoxRenderer, a drop-in replacement for MetalSplatter for debugging integration, which just renders the cube from Apple Metal template

## Minimal early version

There are a lot of optimizations missing here, it's still very much a work in progress, but
I'm putting this out there in case there are any brave curious souls that want to tinker with it.

### TODO / general shortcomings

* Reduce precision to improve memory usage
* Precompute the covariance matrix, to slightly reduce memory usage and time spent in the vertex shader
* Spherical harmonics
* Chunking up into multiple buffers for scalability past ~4m splats
* Sorting on GPU. Sorting is currently done on the CPU asynchronously at a lower framerate (~10 fps), which increases how often you'll see pops especially when the viewpoint changes quickly
* API documentation
* Export in PLYIO, to help support editors
* Import/export .splat

## Documentation

You're right, the documentation is entirely missing. I mean, it's kinda embarrasing. Still, this was for fun and I'm gonna get to it eventually, after some of the higher-priority TODO items above. In the meantime, feel free to try out the sample app -- just, like I said, don't expect much.

1. Get yourself a gaussian splat PLY file.
   a. Maybe download the [scene data from the original paper](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/) or [Polycam's gallery](https://poly.cam/tools/gaussian-splatting)
   b. Or use [Luma](https://lumalabs.ai), [Polycam](https://poly.cam/tools/gaussian-splatting) to capture and train your own
   c. Go hardcode and train your own locally (here's [a great tutorial](https://www.reshot.ai/3d-gaussian-splatting)).
2. Clone the repo and open SampleApp/MetalSplatter_SampleApp.xcodeproj
3. If you want to run on iOS/visionOS, select your target and set your development team and bundle ID in Signing & Capabilities. On macOS, just have at it.
4. Set your scheme to Release mode. Loading large PLY files is in Debug more than an order of magnitude slower.
5. Run it

## MetalSplatter Model Viewer

There's a simple, official [MetalSplatter model viewer app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metalsplatter/id6476895334) based on this library,
available on visionOS for Vision Pro (support for iOS/macOS is coming later). It's also called MetalSplatter, go figure.

## Acknowledgements

There are no external dependencies; and the basic math to render gaussian splats is straightforward (the basic representation has [been around for decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_splatting)), so there are a lot of great references around and I drew on a lot of 'em to try and understand how it works; there's really very little new here, the recent innovations are about training, not rendering. Nonetheless, I pretty much made every mistake possible while implementing it, and the existance of these three implementations was invaluable to help see what I was doing wrong:
* [Kevin Kwok's WebGL implementation](https://github.com/antimatter15/splat)
* [Aras Pranckeviƒçius's Unity implementation](https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting) and series of very insightful blog posts: [1](https://aras-p.info/blog/2023/09/05/Gaussian-Splatting-is-pretty-cool/), [2](https://aras-p.info/blog/2023/09/13/Making-Gaussian-Splats-smaller/), [3](https://aras-p.info/blog/2023/09/27/Making-Gaussian-Splats-more-smaller/)
